# Manas - Your AI Wellness Sanctuary üßò‚ú®


Manas is a full-stack, AI-powered web application designed to be a personal sanctuary for mental wellness. It combines a beautiful, calming user interface with a suite of mindfulness tools, all powered by a sophisticated hybrid AI backend. This project was developed as a comprehensive demonstration of integrating multiple AI models to create a cohesive and responsive user experience.

## ‚ú® Features

Manas is more than just a collection of tools; it's an immersive environment.

*   **Ethereal UI:** A dynamic, animated background with twinkling stars and shifting auroras that react to mouse movement, creating a peaceful and engaging space.
*   **AI Chat Companion:** Have a supportive conversation with Nuru, your empathetic AI guide, powered by Google's Gemini API.
*   **Mood-Aware Generation:** The application adapts to you. The **Poem Generator** automatically creates verse based on your last logged mood.
*   **Multi-Modal AI:**
    *   **Echo Cave:** A text-to-audio feature that composes original, ambient soundscapes based on a word or feeling you provide, using the MusicGen model.
    *   **Speech Integration:** Built with Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text capabilities for future voice-based interactions.
*   **Mindfulness Toolkit:**
    *   **Breathing Guide:** Animated visual guides for mindfulness exercises like Box Breathing.
    *   **Guided Meditation:** AI-generated meditation scripts tailored to your chosen topic and duration.
    *   **Digital Detox:** A focused timer to help you disconnect and recenter.
*   **AI Goal Coach:** Define a personal goal and receive a supportive, structured 3-step action plan generated by Gemini.
*   **Safe Zone Locator:** Uses the OpenStreetMap API to find nearby quiet places like parks and libraries.

## üöÄ The Uniqueness: A Hybrid AI Backend

What sets Manas apart is its intelligent backend architecture. Instead of relying on a single, costly AI service, it uses a **hybrid model** to balance power, speed, and cost-effectiveness.

1.  **Cloud Power (Google Gemini):** For tasks requiring deep reasoning, creativity, and natural language understanding (like chat, goal coaching, and poem writing), the backend makes API calls to **Google's `gemini-1.5-flash-latest` model**. This ensures high-quality, human-like responses.
2.  **Local Specialization (Hugging Face Models):** For specialized, computationally intensive tasks, the backend uses free, open-source models running locally via the `transformers` library:
    *   **Audio Generation:** `facebook/musicgen-small` to compose unique soundscapes.
    *   **Speech-to-Text:** `openai/whisper-base` for accurate transcriptions.
    *   **Text-to-Speech:** `microsoft/speecht5_tts` for generating spoken voice.

This hybrid approach is a powerful design pattern for building complex AI applications efficiently, using the best tool for each specific job.
